# KeyboardSwitchBackpack

These files allow you to create a small circuit board that fits on the back of a standard Cherry MX-type keyboard switch. This backpack contains a 1n4148 diode, a current limiting resistor, and an LED, all fitting underneath the slot on the back of the keyboard switch for SMD LEDs. I tested this on a set of Gateron Clear switches and all the components fit easily in the recess on the back of the switch, but YMMV.
